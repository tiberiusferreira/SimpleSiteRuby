# ShopFinder 

Just a simple Website written mostly in Ruby

Its propose is to help me learn Ruby and Ruby on Rails

It uses a database of Shops and its location given by a CSV file and imported by the Rake task create_shops

The website itself is very simple and shows a Google Maps view where the user can filter the Shops closest to him by distance or number of shops as can be seen below
